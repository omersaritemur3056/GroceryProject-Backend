# GroceryProject-Backend

What is the purpose of the project and what problem does it solve?

This web application designed for a medium-sized market aims to improve the system's operation by managing the market's 
internal dynamics and combining marketing and technology through its e-commerce feature to achieve stable growth and 
become a leader in the industry.

One of the main objectives is to manage and develop the market's internal dynamics by monitoring stock levels, 
managing products, and controlling the status of market employees.

Secondly, and equally important, it provides customers with the opportunity to shop online and promises time savings by 
delivering their orders to their doorsteps without disrupting their comfort.

Those who are curious about the technical specifications of the project can examine it, and those who have questions or 
want to contribute can contact me on Discord at "ömer sarıtemur#6264" :)
